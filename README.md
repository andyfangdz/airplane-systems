# Airplane Systems

Interactive 3D study models of four airplanes' systems, built from **POH/AFM Section 7 – Airplane and Systems**: the Cirrus SR20 G6, the Cessna 172S NAV III (G1000 + GFC 700), the Cessna 182T NAV III (G1000 + KAP 140) and the Diamond DA40 XLS (G1000 + GFC 700). Pick an airplane and a system to fly the camera to it, hover parts for notes, and operate switches, levers and failures. The systems are linked: pull an alternator and the buses, displays and alert window respond. Each airplane keeps its own switch positions when you switch to another, and the URL path (`/c172s/electrical`) names the view shown.

Built with **Next.js 16 (App Router)**, **React Three Fiber**, **drei** and **zustand**.

> Unofficial study aid. Always use the POH/AFM and supplements for your serial number.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build
npm run check      # formatting, typecheck and tests (what CI runs, plus the build)
npm run format     # format everything with Prettier
npm run shot -- c172s/electrical   # screenshot a view (or an airplane, or "all") into .shots/
```

`npm install` also sets up a pre-commit hook that formats staged files. `npm run shot` needs Chromium for Playwright
(`npx playwright-core install chromium`); with `--compare <dir>` it reports which views changed against an earlier set.

## What's modelled

The SR20 is described below. The Cessnas and the DA40 cover their own POH/AFM Section 7 the same way (see each airplane's rail), with a NAV III / DA40 electrical solver and its live power distribution diagram, live G1000 PFD/MFD textures and a working autopilot (GFC 700 or KAP 140) driving a simple flight-state model.

### State model

- **View state** (which airplane and system, x-ray, labels, theme, camera requests, hover) is shared in `lib/view.ts`.
- **Discrete state** (switches, levers, selections) lives in each airplane's zustand store as an immutable `Sim` object. Every update recomputes that airplane's solution `E` (buses, powered loads, …) with a pure `solve` function that is easy to test.
- **Continuous values** (RPM, flap angle, flight state, autopilot state, CAPS time) live in each airplane's mutable `live` object advanced in `useFrame`, so animation doesn't re-render React. Panels that show them use a small `useTicker` hook.

How to add an airplane, and where each kind of code goes: [aircraft/README.md](aircraft/README.md).

## Sources

SR20 (each other airplane cites its POH/AFM, supplements and CRG in its files and panels):

- Cirrus SR20 POH, P/N 11934-005 Reissue A — Section 7 (systems), Section 1 Figure 1-1 (three view, used for the fuselage profile), Section 2 limits and markings, Sections 3 and 3A (CAS message names, best glide), the Section 4 speeds used on the PFD, and the Section 5 cruise table (percent power).
- Garmin Cirrus Perspective+ Pilot's Guide 190-02183-03 and the Cirrus Perspective+ brochure — display layout and bezels.
- Mid-Continent MD302 Standby Attitude Module Pilot's Guide and Installation Manual — the standby instrument.
- Side photos of SR20 G6 OO-CBB (s/n 2347), Wikimedia Commons — tailcone, fin and window outlines.
- Costanzo Air Flight School, _Cirrus SR20 Systems_ deck — electrical readouts, battery-endurance rule of thumb, and photo detail (horn balances, static wicks, OAT probes, ECS knob). Where it differs from the POH, the POH wins and the page says so.

Geometry is approximate. CAS and annunciation text follow the documents; the conditions that trigger them are simplified.
